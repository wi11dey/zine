[[./zine.svg]]

Zine is an environment. A cozy one.

Elisp is completely supported, as is ECMAScript. All is compiled down to R^{6}RS Scheme and run on Chez.

Zine is a unity of Elisp packages, Guix packages, Nyxt, Linux from Scratch, and Racket.

* Naming

Much as GNUâ€™s Not Unix, Zine Is Not Emacs.
